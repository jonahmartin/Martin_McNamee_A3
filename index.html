      Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is an Oceanian country comprising 
      the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller 
      islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. Neighbouring countries 
      include Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands 
      and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. For at least 40,000 
      years before the first British settlement in the late 18th century, Australia was 
      inhabited by indigenous Australians, who spoke languages grouped into roughly 250 
      language groups. After the European discovery of the continent by Dutch explorers 
      in 1606, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain in 1770 and initially 
      settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 
      1788. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades; the continent was explored 
      and an additional five self-governing crown colonies were established. On 1 January 
      1901, the six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. Since 
      federation, Australia has maintained a stable liberal democratic political system 
      that functions as a federal parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy 
      comprising six states and several territories. The population of 23.6 million 
      is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated in the eastern states and on the 
      coast. Australia is a developed country and one of the wealthiest in the world, 
      with the world's 12th-largest economy. In 2014 Australia had the world's 
      fifth-highest per capita income. Australia's military expenditure is the world's 
      13th-largest. With the second-highest human development index globally, Australia 
      ranks highly in many international comparisons of national performance, such as 
      quality of life, health, education, economic freedom, and the protection of civil 
      liberties and political rights. Australia is a member of the United Nations, G20, 
      Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
      (OECD), World Trade Organization, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and the Pacific 
      Islands Forum.

Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and the Latin American region. 
It is the world's fifth-largest country, both by geographical area and by population. It is the largest Portuguese-speaking country 
in the world, and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 km (4,655 mi). 
It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and occupies 47.3 percent of the continent of South America. Its 
Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural 
resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and 
is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. Brazil was inhabited by 
numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral, who claimed the area for the Portuguese Empire. 
Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808, when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro. In 1815, 
the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Independence 
was achieved in 1822 with the creation of the Empire of Brazil, a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary 
system. The ratification of the first constitution in 1824 led to the formation of a bicameral legislature, now called the National Congress. 
The country became a presidential republic in 1889 following a military coup d'état. An authoritarian military junta came to power in 1964 and 
ruled until 1985, after which civilian governance resumed. Brazil's current constitution, formulated in 1988, defines it as a federal republic. 
The federation is composed of the union of the Federal District, the 26 states, and the 5,570 municipalities. Brazil's economy is the world's 
ninth-largest by nominal GDP and seventh-largest by GDP (PPP) as of 2015. A member of the BRICS group, Brazil until 2010 had one of the world's 
fastest growing major economies, with its economic reforms giving the country new international recognition and influence. Brazil's national 
development bank plays an important role for the country's economic growth. Brazil is a founding member of the United Nations, the G20, BRICS, 
Unasul, Mercosul, Organization of American States, Organization of Ibero-American States, CPLP and the Latin Union. Brazil is a regional power 
in Latin America and a middle power in international affairs, with some analysts identifying it as an emerging global power. One of the world's 
major breadbaskets, Brazil has been the largest producer of coffee for the last 150 years.

Canada is a country, consisting of ten provinces and three territories, in the northern part 
of the continent of North America. It extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward 
into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles) in 
total, making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country 
by land area. Canada's common border with the United States forms the world's longest land border. 
Canada is sparsely populated overall, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest 
and tundra as well as the mountain range of the Rocky Mountains; about four-fifths of the population 
live near to the southern border. The majority of Canada has a cold or severely cold winter climate, 
but southerly areas are warm in summer. The land now called Canada has been inhabited for millennia by 
various Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the late 15th century, British and French colonies were established 
on the region's Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various conflicts, the United Kingdom gained and lost North 
American territories until left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly comprises Canada today. Pursuant to the 
British North America Act, on July 1, 1867, three colonies joined to form the autonomous federal Dominion of Canada. 
This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the new self-governing Dominion. In 1931, Britain granted Canada 
near total independence with the Statute of Westminster 1931 and full sovereignty was attained when the Canada Act 
1982 severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament. Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy 
and a constitutional monarchy, Queen Elizabeth II being the current head of state. The country is officially bilingual 
at the federal level. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale 
immigration from many countries, with a population of approximately 35 million as of 2015. Its advanced economy is the eleventh largest 
in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada's long and complex 
relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture. Canada is a developed country and one of the wealthiest 
in the world, with the tenth highest nominal per capita income globally, and the eighth highest ranking in the Human Development Index. It ranks among 
the highest in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. Canada is a 
Commonwealth Realm member of the Commonwealth of Nations, a member of the Francophonie, and part of several major international and intergovernmental 
institutions or groupings including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the G8, the Group of Ten, the G20, the North American Free Trade Agreement 
and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a sovereign state in East Asia. 
It is the world's most populous country, with a population of over 1.35 billion. The PRC is 
a single-party state governed by the Communist Party, with its seat of government in the 
capital city of Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, 
four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing), and two mostly 
self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau); while claiming 
sovereignty over Taiwan. Covering approximately 9.6 million square kilometers, 
China is the world's second-largest country by land area, and either the third or 
fourth-largest by total area, depending on the method of measurement.[i] China's landscape 
is vast and diverse, ranging from forest steppes and the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts in the 
arid north to subtropical forests in the wetter south. The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and 
Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from South and Central Asia. The Yangtze and Yellow 
Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely 
populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 kilometres 
(9,000 mi) long, and is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East and South China Seas. China is a 
cradle of civilization, with its known history beginning with an ancient civilization – one 
of the world's earliest – that flourished in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the 
North China Plain. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, 
known as dynasties, beginning with the semi-mythological Xia of the Yellow River basin(c. 2800 
BCE)[citation needed]. Since 221 BCE, when the Qin Dynasty first conquered several states to 
form a Chinese empire, the country has expanded, fractured and reformed numerous times. The 
Republic of China (ROC) overthrew the last dynasty in 1911, and ruled the Chinese mainland 
until 1949. After World War II, the Communist Party defeated the nationalist Kuomintang in 
mainland China and established the People's Republic of China in Beijing on 1 October 1949, 
while the Kuomintang relocated the ROC government to its present capital of Taipei. China had 
the largest and most complex economy in the world for most of the past two thousand years, 
during which it has seen cycles of prosperity and decline. Since the introduction of economic 
reforms in 1978, China has become one of the world's fastest-growing major economies. As of 
2014, it is the world's second-largest economy by nominal total GDP and largest by purchasing 
power parity (PPP). China is also the world's largest exporter and second-largest importer of 
goods. China is a recognized nuclear weapons state and has the world's largest standing army, 
with the second-largest defence budget. The PRC has been a United Nations member since 1971, 
when it replaced the ROC as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. China is also a 
member of numerous formal and informal multilateral organizations, including the WTO, APEC, 
BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the BCIM and the G-20. China is a great power 
and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.

      Cuba, officially the Republic of Cuba, is a country comprising the islands of Cuba, 
      Isla de la Juventud and several archipelagos in the Caribbean Sea. The capital and 
      largest city Havana is 365 km (227 mi) from Miami, Florida, and geographically it is 
      considered part of North America. Culturally, Cuba is considered part of Latin America. 
      Prior to Spanish colonization in the late 15th century, Cuba was inhabited by Amerindian 
      tribes. It remained a colony of Spain until the Spanish–American War of 1898, which led 
      to nominal independence as a de facto U.S. protectorate in 1902. As a fragile republic, 
      Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system, but mounting political radicalization 
      and social strife culminated in the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1952. Further 
      unrest and instability led to Batista's ousting in January 1959 by the July 26 movement, 
      which afterwards established a government under the leadership of Fidel Castro. Since 1965, 
      the country has been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba. Cuba is the largest island in 
      the Caribbean, and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million 
      inhabitants. It is a multiethnic country whose people, culture and customs derive 
      from diverse origins, including the aboriginal Taíno and Ciboney peoples, the long 
      period of Spanish colonialism, the introduction of African slaves, and a close relationship 
      with the Soviet Union in the Cold War. Although it fares poorly in metrics of political and 
      economic freedom, Cuba is ranked very high in human development by the United Nations, and 
      performs well in health and education. In 2015, it became the first country to eradicate 
      mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis, a milestone hailed by the World Health 
      Organization as "one of the greatest public health achievements possible".

Egypt, officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the 
northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia, via a land bridge formed by the 
Sinai Peninsula. It is the world's only contiguous Eurafrasian nation. Most of Egypt's 
territory of 1,010,408 square kilometres (390,000 sq mi) lies within the Nile Valley. 
Egypt is a Mediterranean country. It is bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the 
northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the 
south and Libya to the west. Egypt has one of the longest histories of any modern country, 
arising in the tenth millennium BC as one of the world's first nation states. Considered a 
cradle of civilisation, Ancient Egypt experienced some of the earliest developments of writing, 
agriculture, urbanisation, organised religion and central government in history. Iconic monuments 
such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx, as well the ruins of Memphis, Thebes, Karnak, 
and the Valley of the Kings, reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of archaeological 
study and popular interest worldwide. Egypt's rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its 
national identity, having endured and at times assimilated various foreign influences, including 
Greek, Persian, Roman, Arab, Ottoman, and European. Although Christianised during the Common Era, 
it was subsequently Islamised due to the Islamic conquests of the 7th century. With over 90 
million inhabitants, Egypt is the most populous country in North Africa and the Arab World, 
the third-most populous in Africa (after Nigeria and Ethiopia), and the fifteenth-most populous 
in the world. The great majority of its people live near the banks of the Nile River, an area of 
about 40,000 square kilometres (15,000 sq mi), where the only arable land is found. The large 
regions of the Sahara desert, which constitute most of Egypt's territory, are sparsely inhabited. 
About half of Egypt's residents live in urban areas, with most spread across the densely populated 
centres of greater Cairo, Alexandria and other major cities in the Nile Delta. Modern Egypt is 
considered to be a regional and middle power, with significant cultural, political, and military 
influence in North Africa, the Middle East and the Muslim world. Its economy is one of the largest 
and most diversified in the Middle East, with sectors such as tourism, agriculture, industry and 
services at almost equal production levels. In 2011, longtime President Hosni Mubarak stepped down 
amid mass protests. Later elections saw the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, which was ousted by the 
army a year later amid mass protests.

Ethiopia, officially known as the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 
is a country located in the Horn of Africa. It is bordered by Eritrea to the 
north and northeast, Djibouti and Somalia to the east, Sudan and South Sudan to 
the west, and Kenya to the south. With over 100 million inhabitants, Ethiopia is 
the most populous landlocked country in the world, as well as the second-most populous 
nation on the African continent after Nigeria. It occupies a total area of 1,100,000 
square kilometres (420,000 sq mi), and its capital and largest city is Addis Ababa. Some 
of the oldest evidence for anatomically modern humans has been found in Ethiopia, which 
is widely considered the region from which Homo sapiens first set out for the Middle East 
and points beyond. According to linguists, the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations settled 
in the Horn region during the ensuing Neolithic era. Tracing its roots to the 2nd millennium BC, 
Ethiopia was a monarchy for most of its history. During the first centuries AD the Kingdom of 
Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region. followed by Abyssinia circa 1137. Ethiopia 
derived prestige with its uniquely successful military resistance during the late 19th-century 
Scramble for Africa, becoming the only African country to defeat a European colonial power and 
retain its sovereignty. Subsequently, many African nations adopted the colors of Ethiopia's flag 
following their independence. It was the first independent African member of the 20th-century 
League of Nations and the United Nations. In 1974, at the end of Haile Selassie's reign, power 
fell to a communist military junta known as the Derg, backed by the Soviet Union, until it 
was defeated by the EPRDF, which has ruled since about the time of the collapse of the USSR in 
1991. Ethiopia is a multilingual nation with around 80 ethnolinguistic groups, the three 
largest of which are the Tigray, Oromo and Amhara. Most people in the country speak 
Afroasiatic languages of the Cushitic or Semitic branches. Additionally, Omotic languages 
are spoken by Omotic ethnic minority groups inhabiting the southern regions, and languages from 
the Nilo-Saharan phylum are also spoken by the nation's Nilotic ethnic minorities. Ethiopia is 
the origin of the coffee bean. It is a land of natural contrasts, with its vast fertile West, 
jungles, and numerous rivers, the world's hottest settlement of Dallol in its north, Africa's 
largest continuous mountain ranges and the largest cave in Africa at Sof Omar. Ethiopia has the 
most UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Africa. Ethiopia's ancient Ge'ez script, also known as 
Ethiopic, is one of the oldest alphabets still in use in the world. The Ethiopian calendar, 
which is seven years and around three months behind the Gregorian calendar, co-exists alongside 
the Oromo calendar. A slight majority of the population adheres to Christianity (mainly the 
Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Pentay), while around a third follows Islam (primarily 
the Sunni denomination). The country is the site of the Hijrah to Abyssinia and the oldest Muslim 
settlement in Africa at Negash. A substantial population of Ethiopian Jews, known as Beta Israel, 
resided in Ethiopia until the 1980s but most of them have since gradually emigrated to Israel. 
Ethiopia is one of the founding members of the UN, the Group of 24 (G-24), the Non-Aligned 
Movement, G-77 and the Organisation of African Unity, with Addis Ababa serving as the headquarters 
of the African Union, the Pan African Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the UNECA, African 
Aviation Training HQ, the African Standby Force and much of global NGOs focused on Africa. 
Despite being the main source of the Nile, the longest river on Earth, Ethiopia underwent a 
series of famines in the 1980s, exacerbated by civil wars and adverse geopolitics. The country 
has begun to recover recently and now has the largest economy (by GDP) in East Africa and Central 
Africa. According to Global Fire Power, Ethiopia has the 46th most powerful military in the world.

Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic 
in western-central Europe. It includes 16 constituent states and covers an area of 357,021 
square kilometres (137,847 sq mi) with a largely temperate seasonal climate. Its capital and 
largest city is Berlin. With 81 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member 
state in the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular migration 
destination in the world. Various Germanic tribes have occupied northern Germany since classical 
antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before 100 CE. During the Migration Period 
the Germanic tribes expanded southward. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed 
a central part of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became 
the centre of the Protestant Reformation. The rise of Pan-Germanism inside the German Confederation 
resulted in the unification of many of the German states in 1871 into the Prussian-dominated 
German Empire. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–1919, the Empire was replaced 
by the parliamentary Weimar Republic. The establishment of the Third Reich in 1933 led to World 
War II and the Holocaust. After 1945, Germany split into two states, East Germany and West Germany. 
In 1990, the country was reunified. In the 21st century, Germany is a great power and has the world'
s fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP, as well as the fifth-largest by PPP. As a global leader 
in several industrial and technological sectors, it is both the world's third-largest exporter and 
importer of goods. Germany is a developed country with a very high standard of living sustained by 
a skilled and productive society. It upholds a social security and universal health care system, 
environmental protection and a tuition-free university education. Germany was a founding member of 
the European Union in 1993. It is part of the Schengen Area, and became a co-founder of the 
Eurozone in 1999. Germany is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the G8, the G20, and the OECD. 
The national military expenditure is the 9th highest in the world. Known for its rich cultural 
history, Germany has been continuously the home of influential artists, philosophers, musicians, 
sportsmen, entrepreneurs, scientists and inventors.

Guatemala, officially the Republic of Guatemala, 
is a country in Central America bordered by Mexico 
to the north and west, the Pacific Ocean to the southwest, Belize to the northeast, the Caribbean 
to the east, Honduras to the east and El Salvador to the southeast. With an estimated population 
of around 15.8 million, it is the most populous state in Central America. A representative 
democracy, Guatemala's capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción, also 
known as Guatemala City. The territory of modern Guatemala once formed the core of the Mayan 
civilization, which extended across Mesoamerica. Most of the country was conquered by the 
Spanish in the 16th century, becoming part of the viceroyalty of New Spain. Guatemala attained 
independence in 1821 as part of the Federal Republic of Central America, which dissolved in 1841. 
From the mid to late 19th century, Guatemala experienced chronic instability and civil strife. 
Beginning in the early 20th century, it was ruled by a series of dictators backed by the United 
Fruit Company and the United States government. In 1944, authoritarian leader Jorge Ubico was 
overthrown by a pro-democratic military coup, initiating a decade-long revolution that led to 
sweeping social and economic reforms. A U.S.-backed military coup in 1954 ended the revolution 
and installed a dictatorship. From 1960 to 1996, Guatemala endured a bloody civil war fought 
between the U.S.-backed government and leftist rebels, which included massacres of the Mayan 
population perpetrated by the military. Since a United Nations-negotiated peace accord, 
Guatemala has witnessed both economic growth and successful democratic elections, though 
it continues to struggle with high rates of poverty, crime, drug trade, and instability. 
Guatemala's abundance of biologically significant and unique ecosystems, which includes a 
large number of endemic species, contributes to Mesoamerica's designation as a biodiversity 
hotspot. The country is also known for its rich and distinct culture, which is characterized by 
a fusion of Spanish and Indigenous influences.

Iran, also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran, is a country in Western Asia. 
It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the de facto Nagorno-Karabakh, and Azerbaijan; with 
Kazakhstan and Russia across the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by 
Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west 
by Turkey and Iraq. Comprising a land area of 1,648,195 km2 (636,372 sq mi), it is the 
second-largest nation in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 78.4 million 
inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th most populous nation. It is the only country that has 
both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. Iran has long been of geostrategic importance 
because of its central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of 
Hormuz. Iran is home to one of the world's oldest civilizations, beginning with the formation of 
the Proto-Elamite and Elamite kingdoms in 3200–2800 BC. The Iranian Medes unified the area into 
the first of many empires in 625 BC, after which it became the dominant cultural and political 
power in the region. Iran reached the pinnacle of its power during the Achaemenid Empire founded 
by Cyrus the Great in 550 BC, which at its greatest extent comprised major portions of the ancient 
world, stretching from parts of the Balkans (Thrace-Macedonia, Bulgaria-Paeonia) and Eastern 
Europe proper in the west, to the Indus Valley in the east, making it the largest empire the 
world had yet seen. The empire collapsed in 330 BC following the conquests of Alexander the 
Great. The Parthian Empire emerged from the ashes and was succeeded by the Sassanid Dynasty 
in 224 AD, under which Iran again became one of the leading powers in the world, along with 
the Roman-Byzantine Empire, for a period of more than four centuries. In 633 AD, Rashidun 
Muslims invaded Iran and conquered it by 651 AD, largely replacing the indigenous faiths of 
Manichaeism and Zoroastrianism. Iran became a major contributor to the Islamic Golden Age, 
producing many influential scientists, scholars, artists, and thinkers. Establishment of the 
Safavid Dynasty in 1501, which promoted Twelver Shia Islam as the official religion, marked 
one of the most important turning points in Iranian and Muslim history. Starting in 1736 under 
Nader Shah, Iran reached its greatest territorial extent since the Sassanid Empire, briefly 
possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time. During the 19th century, 
Iran irrevocably lost swaths of its territories in the Caucasus which made part of the concept 
of Iran for centuries, to neighboring Imperial Russia. Popular unrest culminated in the Persian 
Constitutional Revolution of 1906, which established a constitutional monarchy and the nation's 
first parliament. Following a coup d'état instigated by the U.K. and the U.S. in 1953, Iran 
gradually became close allies with the United States and the rest of the West, remained secular, 
but grew increasingly autocratic. Growing dissent against foreign influence and political 
repression culminated in the 1979 Revolution, which led to the establishment of an Islamic 
republic on 1 April 1979. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its 
leading cultural and economic center. Iran is a major regional and middle power, exerting 
considerable influence in international energy security and the world economy through its 
large reserves of fossil fuels, which include the largest natural gas supply in the world 
and the fourth-largest proven oil reserves. Iran's rich cultural legacy is reflected in part 
by its 19 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the fourth-largest number in Asia and 12th-largest in 
the world. Iran is a founding member of the UN, ECO, NAM, OIC, and OPEC. Its political system 
is based on the 1979 Constitution which combines elements of a parliamentary democracy with a 
theocracy governed by Islamic jurists under the concept of a Supreme Leadership. A multicultural 
nation comprising numerous ethnic and linguistic groups, most inhabitants are officially Shia, 
and Persian is the official language.
